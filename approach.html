				<h2>what we build</h2>
				<p>We build a<span class="star">*</span> software, simultaneously qualitative and moonshot. We can distill state of the art research from academia into purposeful product designs, built with modern technologies at industry standards of quality.</p>

				<h3>how we build</h3>
				<p>We strive to ask the right question before hurrying into the wrong answer. BIG said it well: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_W48ZsIqSo&t=1m19s" target="_blank">good design is careful; bad design is careless</a>. We ask questions from our people, products and the Universe. And then we build it.</p>

				<h3>why we build</h3>
				<p>Motivated by a product that makes peoples' lives better, we plan, design, develop, test, measure, optimize and follow up on it. We want to win just as you do and this drives us to immerse ourselves in solving deep problems.</p>

				<h3>when we build</h3>
				<p>We achieve a healthy mix of agility and reliability. We split the product roadmap into time intervals called sprints. This helps us estimate, convey, perform and assess our work with higher and higher precision over time.</p>

				<h3>where we build</h3>
				<p>By having a team with players in both Copenhagen and Iasi we afford to enjoy a face to face conversation. This helps us - and you - navigate ambiguity, address challenges and get a first-hand experience to the grand mission.</p>

				<h3>how we charge</h3>
				<p>Our pricing depends on the people and time needed to release a product. For example, an iOS app such as <a href="./samples-habitlab.html" target="_blank">Habitlab</a> may take 2 senior software engineers up to 3 months of work, at a monthly personal rate of €4K, or €24K in total.</p>
