				<h3>King of focus</h3>
                <p>In a quite funny way, Adrian was known as &quot;the last one&quot; at football. Months later he became &quot;the first one&quot;. His ability to go from zero to hero in everything is amazing, but it is all about focus.</p>

				<h3>Lending a hand</h3>
                <p>Adrian is more than happy to help people pro-bono to achieve their goals, if they run the extra mile and hang in there getting punched in the face. He shoots straight for what matters, in work and life.</p>

				<h3>Lead guitarist</h3>
                <p>When not writing code he road trips on his bike, enjoys his time as lead guitar singer in a mountain cabin full of people, or reads about economy and philosophy to understand the world he lives in.</p>
