                <p class="title">educational software</p>
                <p>Explained three classic dynamic programming problems on examples, step by step: the discrete knapsack, the longest increasing subsequence and the triangle maximum sum. Fun stuff, if you are into algorithms. :)</p>

                    <figcaption>The first problem presented is finding the triangle maximum sum by walking the triangle from top to bottom and gain as many points as possible on the way. Here one can see the decision: go bottom left or bottom right?</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>We focused on the understanding of recurrence formulas, which are crucial for solving such problems. Here we show how the solution can be found in more ways: from the top or from the bottom.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>A second dynamic problem is the longest increasing subsequence: how to hop from left to right on increasing positions so that their sum is the highest possible. Here a solution to the problem is constructed.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>We focused on showing how a simple approach to the problem does not always work. A more advanced method, such as the dynamic programming method, is necessary to solve the problem in all cases.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>The third problem is the discrete knapsack on a travel example: one must place various items in a bag so that their total price is within a budget and their importances are as high as possible within the budget.</figcaption>
