                <p>The .campion educational archive was implemented by Vlad Manea<span class="star">*</span> and the two professors who managed the .campion program <a target="_blank" href="http://ler.is.edu.ro/~ema">Emanuela Cerchez</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://ler.is.edu.ro/~marinel">Marinel Șerban</a>, also the ones who first taught Vlad how to code.</p>
                <p>The archive launched in September 2009, after 9 months of development. Since then the archive has been used extensively by students and teachers across the country. To this day, the grader receives several solutions per minute.</p>
                <p>A paper on the .campion educational archive obtained the excellence award at the 7th edition of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cniv.ro/2009">National Conference on Virtual Learning</a>.</p>
