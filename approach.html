				<h3>How we build</h3>
				<p>We invite our customers, and their customers, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design" target="_blank">co-create</a> the project. This helps us observe and understand our client, ask questions, prioritize features, solve challenges and deliver a superior product.</p>

				<h3>Why we build</h3>
				<p>Motivated by a product that makes peoples' lives better, we plan, design, develop, test, measure, optimize and follow up on it. We want to win just as you do, and this drives us to solve deep problems.</p>

				<h3>When we build</h3>
				<p>We achieve a healthy mix of agility and reliability. We split the roadmap into time intervals called sprints. This helps us estimate, convey, perform and assess our work with higher and higher precision over time.</p>

				<h3>Where we build</h3>
				<p>By having a team with players in both Copenhagen and Iasi we afford a face to face conversation. This helps us - and you - navigate ambiguity, address challenges and get a first-hand experience to the mission.</p>

				<img class="icon" src="images/icons/Diamond-50-gray.png" alt="How we quote" />
				<h3>How we quote</h3>
				<p>Our pricing depends on the people and time needed to release a product. For example, a product such as <a href="./samples-kmp.html" target="_blank">KMP</a> may take 2 of our software engineers up to 2 months of work, at a monthly personal rate of €4K, or €16K in total.</p>
