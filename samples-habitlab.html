                    <figcaption>Habitlab helped its users discover a <strong>smart</strong>, <strong>sticky</strong> and <strong>social</strong> way to building good habits. A habit consisted of: scheduling a time, inspiring friends, overviewing progress, doing a simple activity and advancing levels.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>Each habit was organized into <strong>programs</strong> tailored for increasing levels of difficulty, <strong>levels</strong> with increasing time spans in weeks, and <strong>loops</strong> with one single, well-defined action. The user was notified before each loop.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>Habitlab implemented 4 types of habits: <strong>unplugging</strong>, <strong>reading</strong>, <strong>running</strong> and <strong>reconnecting</strong>. Loops of all types of habits shared the same habit formation structure: trigger, action and reward.</figcaption>

                <p>Christina Lauer and Vlad Manea<span class="star">*</span> were among the co-founders of the Habitlab startup in Copenhagen, Denmark and led an engineering and design team of 5 people each. See the complete team who contributed to the app <a target="_blank" href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/48692077/Habitlab-iOS-app-for-habit-formation">here</a>.</p>
                <p>The implementation started in a November. The first App Store release was in March. Until July the team improved the app by releasing new features regularly, at a cadence close to the Apple review time: 3-5 days.</p>
                <p>Habitlab qualified to the <a target="_blank" href="http://thinkubator.dk/">Thinkubator</a> think-tank and incubator, a program for high-potential startups with an acceptance rate of 7% in Copenhagen. We worked for 4 months alongside other <a target="_blank" href="http://thinkubator.dk/alumni/">9 startups</a>.</p>
